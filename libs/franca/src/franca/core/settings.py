"""Settings: the schema franca owns, and one call into whence to fill it.

The shapes here -- `RetryPolicy`, `RoutePolicy`, `ProviderSettings`, `Settings` --
are franca's, and they are the whole of what this module decides. Everything about
*getting* values into them (which file, which environment variables, in what order,
and what wins) belongs to `whence`, which exists for exactly this and is shared with
every other package in the workspace.

Three consequences worth knowing.

**Errors carry a file and a line.** whence keeps every value's origin through the
merge and into pydantic's `loc` paths, so a bad `timeout_s` reports
`franca.toml:4:9` rather than just naming the field. `ConfigError` still wraps it,
and no message ever contains the rejected value -- a rejected value may be a key.

**API keys are deliberately absent from `Settings`.** `SettingsKeyProvider` reads
them at call time from the environment, so rotating a key needs no rebuild and no
key is ever held in a model that something might dump. `api_key_env` names the
variable; it never holds the secret.

**The environment spelling is an explicit table, not a pattern.** The original plan
matched `FRANCA_<PROVIDER>_<KEY>` with a regex whose tie-break was "the shortest
provider prefix that leaves a known key wins" -- a heuristic, and one that cannot
distinguish a provider named `my_shim` from a provider `my` with a key `shim_...`.
`ENV_ALIASES` below is finite, generated from the known vendor slugs and the known
field names, and greppable. Any other provider uses whence's unambiguous nested
spelling, `FRANCA_PROVIDERS__MY_SHIM__BASE_URL`, where `__` separates levels and a
single `_` never does.
